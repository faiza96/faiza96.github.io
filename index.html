<h3>Germany's history</h3>
<ul>Germany before 1871: In the middle of the 19th century, Germany was not a unified country but a collection of over 350 principalities and over 1000 small states. This fragmentation and the feudal nature of the society led to frequent conflict and high levels of poverty.</ul>

<h3>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
